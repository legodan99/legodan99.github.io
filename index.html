	<p>the first truly important band of the twenty-first century, death grips have been around for only 7 years, but they've definitely left their mark. after an explosive mainstream entry with the mixtape 'Exmilitary', death grips' sound has been evolved and experimented on for many years, resulting in an alien, unique and innovative style few can match</p>
	<p>5 studio albums later, they're still making sonic breakthroughs and experimenting to deliver the most abrasive, eardrum shattering hip-hop the world has ever seen. their long-awaited 6th album is in the works, due to be released soon</p>
	<p>welcome to the third world, the world of death grips</p>
